Welcome to Board Game Village, where the long-term vision is to connect players and encourage more playing of games in real life. On the user home page, users can keep track of their board game collection and wishlist by searching and adding games from the Board Game Atlas API to their virtual board game shelves, and easily create listings for games they want to sell. In the Marketplace, users can see all listings or get a personalized view of wishlist matches and recommended games. The app uses an original algorithm to analyze each userâ€™s board game collection and wishlist for trends in game mechanics and categories to generate the recommendations.
